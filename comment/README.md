# app description:
This application perform crud operations using django and jquery (without reloading the browser)

## this app inspired by the article bellow with switching Book Model to Comment Model and little changes:
(https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2016/11/15/how-to-implement-a-crud-using-ajax-and-json.html)

## note:
doing some redundant code when performing the crud operation 
i like it to be this way (to make the process of copy and past easy - until a real situation is encountered)
