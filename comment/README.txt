This application perform crud operations using django and jquery (without reloading the browser)

source: (https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2016/11/15/how-to-implement-a-crud-using-ajax-and-json.html)
with some modification:
using 'Comment' model instead of 'Book' model

doing some redundant code when performing the crud operation 
i like it to be this way (to make the code plugable -until another situation is encountered-)
